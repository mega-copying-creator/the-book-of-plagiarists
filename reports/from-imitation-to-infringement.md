## Introduction: The Paradox of the 'Mega Copying Sampler'

The pen name 'Mega Copying Sampler' embodies a central paradox of the modern creative environment. It champions the philosophical proposition that 'no creation is 100% pure,' while simultaneously clashing with the deep-seated negative stigma of the word 'plagiarism.'1 Today, plagiarism signifies more than mere technical borrowing; it implies the ethical bankruptcy of a creator. Yet, tracing the history of creativity reveals that the boundary between imitation and creation was not always so clear. In fact, imitation was once a virtue, and knowledge and culture flourished through the free quotation and variation of ancestral heritage.

This report is an intellectual journey to explore these complex boundaries. Taking the provocative self-identity of the 'Mega Copying Sampler' as a starting point, it traces the historical, linguistic, legal, and philosophical formation of the concept we now take for granted as 'plagiarism.' The narrative begins in antiquity, when imitation was considered the essence of creation, moves through the birth of the 'original author' and the branding of plagiarism as a 'sin,' and follows the consolidation of this idea into the legal institution of copyright. Finally, it examines the counter-discourses that challenge this powerful copyright regime in our digitally dominated society, seeking new possibilities for creation.

This journey aims to be more than a simple chronological listing. It seeks to reveal how our notions of creativity have been shaped by the technological, philosophical, and economic conditions of each era. Through this exploration, this report will deepen the ironic meaning embedded in the name 'Mega Copying Sampler' and provide the intellectual foundation for a more mature and multi-layered understanding of the relationship between imitation and creation.

## Part 1: The World Before Originality: Creation as a Shared Language

### Chapter 1: The Classical Ideal: Mimesis and Imitatio

Unlike the modern obsession with originality as 'creation from nothing,' the essence of creation in the ancient world, the ideological root of Western civilization, was 'imitation.' For creators of this era, imitation was not a source of shame but the most fundamental artistic act and a virtue.

#### The Foundation of Art is Imitation

The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle defined art as "the imitation of nature" (μιˊμησις, mimesis).19 This meant that art was the act of representing the real world as we perceive it. While Plato devalued art, viewing the artist's imitation as a mere 'shadow of a shadow'—a copy of reality, which was itself a shadow of the ideal Forms (Idea)—Aristotle believed that humans derive pleasure and knowledge from imitation.20 For him, tragedy was a sublime art form that evoked feelings of pity and fear through the imitation of human action, leading to an emotional purification (catharsis).21 Thus, for the Greeks, creation was not about inventing an original world but about how deeply and persuasively one could represent the existing nature and human condition.

#### A Dialogue with the Past: Rome's Imitatio

This concept of mimesis evolved into a specific creative methodology in the Roman era known as 'imitatio.' The Romans considered themselves the rightful heirs to Greek culture and regarded the imitation and reinterpretation of Greek art and literature through a Roman spirit as their highest cultural achievement.19 Roman villas were filled with copies of Greek sculptures, and it is thanks to these Roman copies that we can appreciate the greatness of Greek sculpture today, as many of the original Greek works have been lost.22

The same was true in literature. The great Roman poet Virgil's epic, the _Aeneid_, which tells the story of Rome's founding, is a masterpiece that openly borrows and synthesizes the structure and themes of Homer's _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_.23 This was not a secret to be hidden but an ambitious attempt to stand on the shoulders of a giant like Homer, to compete with and surpass him. Rome's elite intellectuals were fluent in Greek as well as Latin, avidly read the Greek classics, and considered it a mark of sophistication to leave traces of Greek literature in their own works.21

The classical view of creation is fundamentally different from the modern one. Creation was not the act of a solitary genius proclaiming a unique voice to the world. It was a dynamic 'dialogue' with the great heritage of the past—a process of constant conversation, competition, and, at times, homage. Creation involved layering the voices of predecessors onto one's own, finding new meaning in the resonance. For them, past texts were not objects to be stolen but a vast cultural commons for shared conversation and play.

### Chapter 2: The Renaissance Workshop: Replication as a Norm

The Renaissance, which sought to 'rebirth' the cultural heritage of ancient Greece and Rome, once again placed the value of imitation at the center of creation.24 For the artists of this era, imitation was not merely following the past but a key methodology for reviving a forgotten great tradition and thereby ushering in a new golden age of art.24

#### Learning Through Imitation

Art education in the Renaissance was centered on the apprentice system, and its core was 'imitation.'26 Young apprentices aspiring to become painters would enter a master's workshop and spend years training by copying the master's works.22 This process was more than just acquiring technical skills; it was about internalizing the master's style, composition, and sense of color—the very essence of their art.22 Just as students in Carl Orff's music education method learn the fundamentals of music by imitating the teacher's movements and rhythms, Renaissance apprentices learned the language of art by imitating their master's works.27

High-quality copies made by these trained apprentices were sometimes sold in the market under the master's name, which was considered payment for their tuition.22 This shows that the distinction between 'original' and 'copy' was not as strict as it is today. What mattered was not who created the work, but whether the work itself met the master's style and standards. Over time, some of these workshop copies were passed off as the master's originals, unintentionally becoming forgeries, but this is a modern perspective. At the time, it was a natural part of the creative and educational process.22

#### 'Forgeries of Homage'

The most dramatic example of the Renaissance view on imitation is an anecdote about Michelangelo, the greatest artist of his time. As a young man, Michelangelo created a sculpture of a sleeping cupid in the ancient Roman style, then deliberately buried it to make it look old and sold it as an ancient artifact.22 By today's standards, this would be clear fraud, but in the context of the time, it can be interpreted differently. His act was a demonstration of his supreme skill in perfectly replicating the style of the ancient masters and a provocative expression of confidence, testing the eyes of the foremost experts of his day.22

In the creative environment of the Renaissance, the quality of the work—'how it was made'—was more important than the identity of the author—'who made it.' Within the collective creative system of the workshop, the work of master and apprentice was closely intertwined, and the concept of the 'author' was not a single individual but a collective entity encompassing the entire workshop. In this environment, imitation was not a lack of creativity but an essential pathway to inheriting a great tradition and creating new art. Originality was not achieved by rejecting imitation, but by perfectly mastering it and then transcending it.

## Part 2: The Invention of the Author and the Sin of Plagiarism

### Chapter 3: The Romantic Revolution: The Cult of Genius

In the late 18th century, Romanticism swept through the intellectual landscape of Europe, completely transforming the concept of creation. This movement, which began as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, rationality, and universality, elevated human emotion, imagination, and, above all, 'individual originality' to the highest values.6 While Classicism sought the perfect execution of established rules and forms, Romanticism saw the essence of art in breaking all rules and unleashing the creator's inner voice.7 Amid this profound ideological shift, a new human ideal—the 'original genius'—was born, and imitation fell from its pedestal of virtue into the abyss of 'sin.'

#### Kant's Theory of Genius and the Birth of Originality

The philosophical foundation for this change was laid by Immanuel Kant. In his _Critique of Judgment_, Kant defined 'genius' as "the talent (natural endowment) which gives the rule to art."30 For Kant, the most crucial characteristic of a genius was 'originality' (Originalität).30 Originality is a capacity that can never be achieved through imitation or learning; it is the ability to delve into the artist's own origin and create something new.30 A genius is not one who follows existing rules but one who creates new rules, a 'new model' (Muster), for future generations to follow.30

Kant's theory of genius bestowed a divine aura upon artistic creation. He described the genius as a "favorite of nature," suggesting that great works could not be born from human rational effort alone but required the aid of an irrational, unknown force, akin to Plato's 'divine madness.'30 Thus, originality was elevated from a mere talent to a mystical ability possessed only by a select few.

#### The Artist as Demigod

Kant's philosophy provided Romantic artists with a powerful sense of self-identity. They were no longer artisans imitating the heritage of the past. They began to see themselves as beings who "create ultimate reality" through imagination, as "rebellious, superhuman, and divine giants."32 Works like Goethe's

_The Sorrows of Young Werther_ and Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ are products of the Romantic spirit, pouring forth intense emotions and turmoil, unbound by social norms.6

This 'cult of genius' brought about a decisive change in the perception of plagiarism. If originality was the sole value of art, then imitation became a failure of the creative soul, an act that cast doubt on one's qualification as an artist. Although the legal and economic concept of ownership over creative works had been established earlier with the Statute of Anne in 1710, it was Romanticism that solidified the moral and ethical condemnation of plagiarism. Romanticism elevated copyright infringement from a simple violation of property rights to a 'sin' that defiled the sacred originality of the creator. Plagiarism thus became a powerful moral standard, judging not only in the courtroom but also in the conscience of the creator, a notion that continues to deeply influence our creative culture to this day.

### Chapter 4: Naming the Crime: The Journey of a Word

A concept gains social reality only when it is given a name. The word 'plagiarism' as we use it today holds a history of its own, and the evolution of its meaning encapsulates how society's view of creative works has changed over time.

#### From Kidnapper to Literary Thief

The English word 'plagiarism' originates from the Latin 'plagiarius.'1 The original meaning of this word was 'kidnapper' or 'abductor,' specifically referring to a trafficker who tricked a free person into slavery.2 The word entered the literary sphere around the 1st century CE through the Roman satirical poet Martial. He accused his rival, Fidentinus, who stole his poems and recited them as his own, exclaiming, "If you want to recite my works as your own, buy them!" He condemned this act as the work of a 'plagiarius' who had stolen his 'slaves' (his works).2

Martial's metaphor was revolutionary. For the first time in history, he conceptualized a creative work as a possession belonging to an individual author, with a personal connection like that to a child or a slave. He equated the act of stealing it not to simple theft but to the powerful crime of 'abduction,' the seizure of a person. This is recorded as one of the earliest assertions of an author's ownership of their creative work.2

#### Entry into English and Establishment of Meaning

It took nearly 1,500 years for the concept of 'plagiarius' to be fully adopted into the English-speaking world. In the early 17th century, the English playwright Ben Jonson introduced the word 'plagiary' into the language to describe someone who committed literary theft.2 However, the word acquired its modern negative connotation during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods of the 18th century.2 As the concepts of the 'original author' and 'genius' became socially established, the act of stealing their creations was no longer seen as a minor literary practice but as a serious intellectual crime and a moral failing.1

#### Distinguishing the Spectrum: Plagiarism, Homage, and Parody

In modern times, we distinguish creative borrowing with more nuanced terms. The key criteria are 'intent' and 'acknowledgment.'1

- **Plagiarism:** The act of intentionally concealing the source of an original work and passing it off as one's own original creation. The core element is 'deception.'1
    
- **Homage:** The act of intentionally imitating a particular scene or style to pay tribute to a respected author or work, with the source clearly acknowledged. It is based on 'respect' for the original.1
    
- **Parody:** The act of exaggerating or twisting the characteristics of an original work for satirical or comedic effect. Since its humor cannot be fully appreciated without knowledge of the original, it necessarily presupposes the original's existence.1
    

Thus, the journey of the word 'plagiarism' reflects a major paradigm shift in how creative works are perceived—from being part of a common heritage to becoming private property, and ultimately, the sacred expression of an author's soul.

## Part 3: The Codification of Creativity: The Legal Structure of Ownership

While Romanticism laid the moral and philosophical groundwork for condemning plagiarism, the modern legal system solidified it into a binding institution. The economic interests spurred by the development of printing gave birth to a new legal right called 'copyright,' which was extended into a global norm through international treaties. As a result, creative works were no longer abstract products of inspiration but legal assets with clearly defined owners, protection periods, and scopes of rights.

### Chapter 5: The Statute of Anne: From Publishers' Monopoly to Author's Right

The world's first modern copyright law was the 'Statute of Anne,' enacted in Great Britain in 1710.4 To understand its origins, one must first look at the publishing environment of the preceding era.

#### The Pre-Copyright Era: Publishing Privileges and Censorship

After Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the mass reproduction of books became possible, dramatically accelerating the spread of knowledge.3 However, this also posed a new threat to state authorities and existing publishers. The state needed to control the distribution of publications containing religiously or politically subversive ideas, while publishers, who invested heavily in printing books, needed to protect their economic interests from piracy.3

The convergence of these two interests led to the system of 'publishing privilege.' In 1557, the English Crown granted the 'Stationers' Company' exclusive rights to printing.3 This guild was responsible for censoring content before publication and cracking down on unauthorized printing. This system was not for the author's rights but for state control and the monopolistic interests of publishers.3

#### A Paradigm Shift: The Emergence of the Statute of Anne

As the reading population grew and authors began to earn income from the general market rather than aristocratic patrons, criticism of the publishers' monopoly and censorship mounted.3 The Statute of Anne emerged from this social change.

The official title of the law is "An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned."36 As the title suggests, the primary purpose of the law was not just to protect copyright as private property but ultimately to serve the public good by 'encouraging learning.' The preamble of the act notes that "Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting, and Publishing... Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors," leading to their ruin, thus stating the need to protect authors' economic rights.3

The key provisions of the Statute of Anne are as follows 37:

1. **Granting Rights to the Author:** It specified the 'Author' as the rights holder of the work, not the publisher.
    
2. **Limited Term of Protection:** It granted a protection period of 21 years for books already in print and 14 years for new books, with an additional 14-year extension possible if the author was still alive.5 This was not a perpetual monopoly; it was designed so that works would enter the public domain after a certain period, allowing anyone to use them freely.
    
3. **Public Interest Mechanisms:** It included provisions for mandatory copyright registration, regulation of unreasonable book prices, and the requirement to deposit new books in royal libraries, ensuring public access.37
    

The Statute of Anne was a major turning point in the history of copyright. It shifted the focus from a perpetual privilege granted by the monarch to a temporary right guaranteed by law, and from the publisher's monopoly to the author's right. Most importantly, from its inception, the law embodied a dual nature: it was not just a system for protecting private property but a social contract designed to encourage creation and ultimately enrich the knowledge and culture of society as a whole. This inherent duality lies at the heart of copyright debates that continue to this day.

### Chapter 6: The Berne Convention: The Author's Dominion Goes Global

In the 19th century, as the publishing industry grew beyond national borders, a new problem emerged. Works protected by copyright law in their home country were frequently pirated and distributed freely abroad.39 Bilateral treaties between individual countries were insufficient, and the need for a multilateral treaty to provide uniform international copyright protection became apparent.39 In response to this demand, the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" was signed in Berne, Switzerland, in 1886.8

The Berne Convention established three core principles that form the foundation of the global copyright system.8

1. **Principle of National Treatment:** Member countries must protect the works of nationals of other member countries to the same extent that they protect the works of their own nationals.8 For example, a novel by a French author receives the same level of legal protection in South Korea as a novel by a Korean author. This is a fundamental principle that eliminates discrimination based on nationality in copyright protection.
    
2. **Principle of Automatic Protection:** Copyright protection arises automatically at the moment a work is created and does not require any formal procedures such as registration, deposit, or the use of a copyright notice (c◯).8 The moment a writer puts down their pen or a painter their brush, the copyright takes effect. This principle removes administrative barriers to copyright protection, making it easier to secure the rights of creators. South Korea's copyright law also adopts this principle of automatic protection.9
    
3. **Protection of Moral Rights:** The Berne Convention explicitly protects 'moral rights,' which are separate from the economic rights (copyright) that can be sold or transferred. These rights protect the personal and spiritual bond between the creator and their work.8 They include the right of the author to claim authorship of the work (right of attribution) and the right to object to any distortion or mutilation of the work that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation (right of integrity). These rights are retained even after the economic rights have been transferred or have expired, serving as an important mechanism to protect the author's honor and personality.8
    

Through these principles, the Berne Convention elevated authors' rights to an international standard. Starting with the initial signatories in 1887, most countries around the world, including the United States (1989), Japan (1899), and South Korea (1996), have joined the convention, giving the exclusive rights of authors over their original creative works powerful legal force that transcends borders.8 Thus, the Romantic ideal of the 'original author' was firmly established as a global legal reality by the 20th century.

## Part 4: The Digital Counterattack: A Challenge to the Copyright Regime

In the latter half of the 20th century, the rise of digital technology and the internet began to crack the solid fortress of copyright. In a digital environment where the cost of copying and transmission approaches zero, the traditional model of distributing physical copies, which the existing copyright system was based on, was fundamentally shaken. This technological shift gave rise to critical voices arguing that excessive copyright protection was hindering creativity and cultural development, leading to the birth of new alternative movements like 'Free Culture' and 'Copyleft.'

### Chapter 7: The Commons Strikes Back: Free Culture and Copyleft

#### Lawrence Lessig's Critique and 'Free Culture'

At the center of this critique is Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Harvard Law School.15 In his book

_Free Culture_, he argues that ever-extending copyright terms and strict regulations are turning the creators of the digital age, who must build upon past cultural heritage, into 'criminals.'16 According to Lessig, culture inherently develops through a process of 'remixing' the past.16 From folktales and recipes to biblical interpretations, human culture has been a history of constant reinterpretation and variation.42 Digital technology has merely accelerated this remix culture exponentially, but copyright laws created in an analog era are obstructing this natural creative process.16

Lessig does not advocate for the abolition of copyright itself but criticizes it for losing its balance between its original purpose of 'encouraging creation' and the 'public good.'41 He argues that while creators should be fairly compensated, their rights should not become a perpetual right of control. Cultural heritage must be returned to the commons at an appropriate time to serve as fertile ground for the next generation's creativity.

#### Copyleft: A Legal Hack Using Copyright Law

One of the most creative solutions to emerge from this critique is 'copyleft.' Initiated by programmer Richard Stallman in 1984, this movement is based on the idea that information and creative works should be freely shared, in opposition to the monopolistic nature of 'copyright.'14

The essence of copyleft is not to abandon copyright law but to use it in reverse to enforce 'sharing.'14 Software or works under a copyleft license (e.g., the GNU General Public License) grant anyone the right to freely use, modify, copy, and distribute them.43 However, there is one crucial condition: any modified or derivative works must also be distributed under the same copyleft license. This is the 'Share-Alike' provision.44 Thanks to this clause, once a work is released under copyleft, it remains forever free as part of the commons and cannot be monopolized by any individual or corporation.

The Creative Commons (CC) license, co-founded by Lawrence Lessig, extends this copyleft spirit beyond software to all creative domains, including images, music, and academic materials.15

Interestingly, this culture of sharing and remixing, facilitated by digital technology, in some ways harks back to the creative methods of the era before copyright and the Romantic concept of originality. Like the 'imitatio' of ancient Rome or the collective creation of Renaissance workshops, digital-age creators also reference and transform each other's work within a vast network, generating new meanings. This suggests that the Romantic ideal of the 'solitary genius' may have been a historical product of a specific technology—the printing press—and the philosophy of its time. Technological change is once again reminding us that the essence of creation lies not in isolated originality but in connected dialogue and collaboration.

### Chapter 8: Boundaries Tested in Court: Key Precedents

The tension between copyright law and creative reality ultimately manifests in court rulings. Two cases, in particular, have had a profound impact on the legal interpretation of the boundary between imitation and creation. One established the concept of 'subconscious plagiarism,' delving into the creator's inner world, while the other redefined the scope of 'fair use,' the core defense for appropriation art.

#### Subconscious Plagiarism: _Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd._

In 1976, the lawsuit alleging that former Beatle George Harrison's hit song 'My Sweet Lord' plagiarized the 1963 song 'He's So Fine' by the girl group The Chiffons became one of the most famous copyright disputes in popular music history.12 Harrison claimed that although he had heard 'He's So Fine,' he did not intentionally copy it.45

In this case, the court established a crucial legal principle. Judge Richard Owen found that the core melodies and harmonic structures of the two songs were "substantially identical" and ruled that even if Harrison did not deliberately copy the song, he had unconsciously used the melody that remained in his subconscious.12 This is the concept of 'subconscious plagiarism.' The ruling clarified that the infringer's 'intent' is not a necessary element for determining copyright infringement. It established the principle that the plaintiff only needs to prove that the defendant had 'access' to the original work and that there is 'substantial similarity' between the two works.47

This verdict sent shockwaves through the creative community. Harrison himself lamented, "I'm so paranoid about touching a guitar or piano in case I'm touching somebody's note."48 The legal line between influence, inspiration, and plagiarism had become extremely blurred. This case illustrates the fundamental difficulty that arises when trying to judge the complex and unconscious aspects of the creative process with the objective measure of the law.

#### The Retreat of Fair Use: _Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith_

In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in a copyright case involving the work of pop art icon Andy Warhol.17 The case centered on whether Warhol's 'Prince Series' of silkscreen prints, based on a photograph of the musician Prince taken by photographer Lynn Goldsmith, constituted copyright infringement.18 The Warhol Foundation argued that Warhol's work was a 'transformative use' that added new meaning and message to the original photograph and thus fell under the 'fair use' exception to copyright infringement.50

However, the Supreme Court did not side with the Warhol Foundation. The Court focused on the fact that the foundation had licensed the work to a magazine for use as an illustration in a tribute article about Prince.51 The Court found that this purpose was "substantially the same commercial purpose" as Goldsmith's original photograph, which was to serve as a 'portrait illustrating an article about Prince.'17

This ruling is significant for narrowing the concept of 'transformative use.' Previously, many courts had primarily considered whether a secondary work had a 'new aesthetic, new expression, or new meaning' different from the original.17 However, the Supreme Court avoided aesthetic and artistic judgments and instead made the key criterion whether the 'specific purpose of the use' of the secondary work commercially competes with the market for the original.53 In other words, no matter how artistically transformed a work is, it is unlikely to be considered fair use if it competes in the same market as the original.55

These two precedents clearly show the difficulties the legal system faces in dealing with the subjective and internal processes of creation. Instead of ambiguous concepts like 'subconscious' or 'artistic meaning,' courts tend to rely on more objective and externally verifiable criteria such as 'access,' 'similarity,' and 'commercial purpose.' While this legal realism increases predictability, it can often be at odds with the reality of the creative process, where inspiration and imitation are intricately intertwined.

## Part 5: A New Philosophy of Creation: The Text as Network

While law and institutions have evolved to strengthen authors' rights and clarify ownership of creative works, philosophy and literary theory in the latter half of the 20th century moved in the opposite direction. Thinkers like Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva questioned the absolute authority of the 'author' and proposed a new perspective where all texts are interconnected within a vast cultural network. This was an intellectual revolution that forced a fundamental reconsideration of the relationship between plagiarism and creation.

### Chapter 9: The Death of the Author, The Birth of the Reader

In 1967, the French literary critic Roland Barthes published a provocative essay titled "The Death of the Author."10 This short piece became one of the most influential texts of 20th-century literary theory.

Barthes criticized the tendency of traditional literary criticism to fixate on the author's intentions, biography, and psychology to find the meaning of a work.10 He saw this approach as an attempt to assign a single, final meaning to the text—the message of the 'Author-God.'56 According to Barthes, the author is not the master who holds a monopoly on the text's meaning. He is merely a conduit through which numerous pre-existing cultural codes and quotations pass.11

Barthes defined a text as "a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash."56 The unity of a text lies not in its origin (the author) but in its destination (the reader). It is the reader who untangles the myriad threads of meaning in the text and weaves new significance. Therefore, "the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author."56

'The Death of the Author' does not mean the physical death of the writer. It is a declaration that the author's absolute authority must be removed from the center of textual interpretation. This theory deconstructed the concept of the 'original author' deified by Romanticism and revealed that meaning is not fixed at the moment of creation but is constantly generated through the act of reading. This fundamentally questioned the basic premise of copyright law that a creative work is the property of its author.

### Chapter 10: Intertextuality: The Unavoidable Mosaic

The person who further refined Roland Barthes' ideas was his student, the Bulgarian-French semiotician Julia Kristeva. Drawing on the 'dialogism' theory of the Russian thinker Mikhail Bakhtin, she proposed the new concept of 'intertextuality.'58

#### Julia Kristeva's Theory

Kristeva declared that "any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another."57 This means that no text exists in complete isolation. Every text, consciously or unconsciously, can only have meaning in relation to countless pre-existing texts (literature, myths, news, everyday conversations, etc.).57 The writer does not create a completely new language but rather takes existing language and expressions, already filled with the voices and meanings of others, and recombines and rearranges them.61

Therefore, every text is itself a site of dialogue with other texts, and meaning is not fixed within the text but arises from the network of relationships 'between' (inter-) texts.62 From this perspective, the act of creation is closer to a creative 'transformation' of existing texts than to pure invention.

#### The Difference Between Intertextuality and Plagiarism

The theory of intertextuality is often misunderstood as suggesting that all creative work is fundamentally 'plagiarism.'60 However, the two concepts are crucially different. Intertextuality is a 'descriptive' theory that explains the essential condition of all texts, whereas plagiarism is a 'prescriptive' concept that defines the violation of a social norm—authorship.63

The key criteria that separate them are 'intent' and 'concealment.'63

- **Intertextuality** is an unavoidable condition of creation. The author does not hide the existence of preceding texts, and the reader recognizes or expects that certain expressions refer to other texts. It is an 'open' dialogue that enriches the meaning of the text.63
    
- **Plagiarism** is an act of intentional 'concealment.' The plagiarist secretly takes a preceding text, fails to credit the source, and tries to 'deceive' the reader into believing it is their own original creation. It is a 'closed' act of theft that severs dialogue and appropriates another's credit.63
    

Ultimately, the theory of intertextuality does not defend plagiarism but rather provides a framework for a more sophisticated understanding of the various forms of creative borrowing. The table below summarizes this spectrum of borrowing.

|Term|Definition|Intent|Acknowledgment|Transformation|Legal/Ethical Status|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Plagiarism**|Presenting another's work as one's own without attribution, with the intent to deceive 1|Deception, fraud|Concealed|Minimal/None|Illegal and unethical|
|**Homage**|Imitating a style or scene to pay respect to a revered author or work 1|Respect, tribute|Open/Expected|Contextual|Ethical|

Thus, the theories of Barthes and Kristeva revealed the true nature of creation hidden behind the myth of 'originality'—that all creation is a dialogue with and a reconstruction of existing culture. This challenges the absolute status of the 'original author' that copyright law seeks to protect and suggests that we view creation not as a matter of ownership but of relationship.

## Part 6: Conclusion: A Framework for the 'Mega Copying Sampler'

This report has shown that the concept of 'plagiarism' is not a fixed, immutable truth but a historical construct, shaped and transformed by the technological, economic, and philosophical demands of its time. The journey has traversed from ancient and Renaissance times when imitation was the essence of creation, through the Romantic era that established the ideal of the 'original genius' and condemned imitation as a sin, to the completion of this notion as a global legal system through the Statute of Anne and the Berne Convention. Finally, it has examined how the new technological environment of the digital age and postmodern philosophy are challenging this robust copyright regime, reinterpreting the essence of creation as 'relationship' and 'network' rather than 'ownership.'

This historical and philosophical examination provides a strong theoretical foundation for the pen name 'Mega Copying Sampler.' This name can be reinterpreted not as the cynical confession of a thief, but as an honest reflection on the nature of the creative process. All creation is an act of 'sampling' from the vast database of ancestral heritage, 'reconstructing' it through one's own filter, and 'transforming' it in a new context. As Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva have shown, the creator is not someone who makes something out of a vacuum but is more like an editor who ties new knots of meaning at the intersection of countless existing texts.

Therefore, the task of the modern creator is not to pursue an impossible 'purity' but to become a more ethical, more transformative, and more self-aware 'sampler.' This presupposes a clear awareness of legal and ethical boundaries. Even if 'intertextuality' is an unavoidable condition of creation, 'plagiarism'—the intentional concealment of sources and the appropriation of others' efforts—must be clearly distinguished. As seen in the cases of George Harrison and Andy Warhol, the legal system judges the subtle process of creation by objective standards like 'substantial similarity' and 'commercial purpose,' and creators cannot ignore these practical constraints.

In conclusion, 'Mega Copying Sampler' can be another name for every creator who builds something new upon the respected heritage of the past. This pen name declares that the act of creation is not a solitary invention but an endless dialogue. This declaration is both the oldest truth running through the history of creation and the most modern truth being reaffirmed in the age of digital networks. Based on this understanding, the delicate tightrope walk at the boundary of imitation and creation is, arguably, the central drama of the creative act today.

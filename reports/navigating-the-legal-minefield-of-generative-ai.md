However, it's important to be aware of the potential legal issues that may arise when using AI results. Please summarize this in a report.

### **Executive Summary**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the copyright and trademark-related legal issues and potential liabilities that creators, developers, and businesses may face when using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce content. While generative AI technology is currently transforming the creative paradigm, its legal foundation remains in a state of uncertainty. It is crucial to recognize that although AI service providers tend to assign ownership of the generated output to users through their terms of service, this does not legally guarantee full copyright protection.

The core analysis of this report is as follows. First, the current copyright law framework (particularly in the United States and South Korea) considers 'human creativity' as a key requirement for copyright protection. Therefore, purely AI-generated works with minimal human creative intervention are highly unlikely to be eligible for copyright protection, meaning they may effectively fall into the public domain. Second, the large-scale unauthorized collection and reproduction of copyrighted works during the training process of generative AI models is a central issue where AI developers assert 'fair use.' However, the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in _Warhol v. Goldsmith_ has shifted the focus of fair use analysis to 'commercial purpose' and the 'effect on the original work's market,' thereby increasing the legal risks for AI developers. Third, users are exposed to the risk of unintentionally infringing on the original author's copyright due to the phenomenon of 'output regurgitation,' where the AI outputs its training data verbatim. Furthermore, AI-generated logos or brand names may be similar to existing trademarks, leading to trademark infringement or 'trademark dilution,' which weakens the distinctiveness of famous marks.

In response to these complex risks, major AI providers are introducing IP indemnification clauses, such as 'Copyright Shield' programs, for their paid enterprise customers. However, these protections are not a complete safeguard, as they contain several exceptions and limitations, such as only applying when the user has not intentionally induced infringement and has used all provided safety features.

In conclusion, while generative AI is a powerful creative tool, the legal status of its output is highly unstable. Users must clearly understand that 'ownership' in AI service terms is not synonymous with legal copyright. To minimize potential legal disputes, users should develop and implement multifaceted risk mitigation strategies, including defensive prompt engineering, due diligence on the rights associated with outputs, and thorough documentation of the human creative contribution process. This report aims to provide a detailed map of this legal landscape, enabling users to make more informed decisions.

## **Part I: The Authorship Problem – Copyright Ownership in the Age of AI**

Who owns the copyright to content generated by AI is one of the most fundamental and contentious legal questions today. While many AI service providers state in their terms that they grant ownership to the user, this conflicts with the basic principles of current copyright law, creating a complex legal dilemma. This chapter begins with the core principle of copyright law, the 'human authorship requirement,' analyzes the stance of regulatory bodies and key precedents on whether AI can be considered a 'tool,' and finally, delves into the legal meaning and limitations of service terms.

### **1.1 The Cornerstone of Copyright Law: The Human Authorship Requirement**

#### **Core Legal Doctrine**

The fundamental premise of copyright protection is that a work must be a creative expression of human thought or emotion. This is a nearly universal principle, not limited to any single country.

U.S. copyright law protects "original works of authorship."1 Courts have consistently interpreted the term "author" to mean a human being, based on the purpose of the copyright system as an incentive for human creative activity.2 It is established law that works generated randomly by a machine or an automated process without creative intervention are not protected by copyright.

South Korea's Copyright Act, in Article 2, Item 1, explicitly defines a "work" as "a creative production that expresses human thoughts and emotions."4 This definition expressly limits the subject of authorship to 'humans,' suggesting that works generated solely by a non-human, such as an AI, are in principle difficult to recognize as copyrighted works.

#### **Non-Human Author Precedent: _Naruto v. Slater_ (The Monkey Selfie Case)**

The case that most clearly illustrates the human authorship principle is _Naruto v. Slater_, also known as the 'monkey selfie case.' In this case, a Celebes crested macaque named 'Naruto' took a selfie using photographer David Slater's camera, and the animal rights organization PETA filed a copyright infringement lawsuit on Naruto's behalf. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ultimately ruled that animals do not have statutory standing to sue under the Copyright Act.6 The court reasoned that if Congress had intended to grant copyright to animals, it would have explicitly stated so in the law, reaffirming the traditional legal interpretation that limits authorship to humans. This precedent serves as an important indicator of the high legal barrier to recognizing copyright for non-human entities like AI.

### **1.2 Is AI a 'Tool'?: The Stance of Regulatory Bodies**

The core of the copyright debate over AI-generated works is whether AI should be seen as the creator or as a tool used by humans. If AI is merely a tool like a camera or Photoshop, its output could be recognized as the creative work of the human who used it. However, regulatory bodies are currently taking a cautious approach to this analogy.

#### **The Position of the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO)**

The U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) has been the most active in expressing its position on AI and copyright issues. The USCO acknowledges that works created with the assistance of AI can be registered for copyright, but only if "a human had creative control over the work's expression."1 In other words, if the AI goes beyond being a mere 'assistive tool' that mechanically follows human instructions and instead determines the literary, artistic, or musical expressive elements of the work, the result is not a human's work.12

Specifically, the USCO explicitly rejects the analogy of generative AI to a camera. While a photographer directly controls various creative elements such as composition, lighting, and subject arrangement, the USCO believes that a user inputting a prompt does not, at the current level of technology, have sufficient control over how the AI will ultimately express the output. Instead, the USCO likens such a user to "a client who gives general instructions to an artist," concluding that the actual creation is performed by the AI system.1

#### **Analysis of Key USCO Decision Cases**

It is crucial to examine how the USCO's 'creative control' standard has been applied in actual cases.

- **_Thaler v. Perlmutter_**: Stephen Thaler applied for copyright registration for an image "autonomously" generated by his AI, the 'Creativity Machine,' "without any human intervention." When the USCO rejected it, he filed a lawsuit, but the federal court upheld the USCO's decision, stating that a work with "no human hand" cannot be protected.1 This ruling legally established the principle that an AI cannot be a sole author.
    
- **_Zarya of the Dawn_**: A graphic novel by Kris Kashtanova combining human-written text with images created by the image-generating AI 'Midjourney.' The USCO ultimately decided that while the human's creative contribution of 'selection, coordination, and arrangement' of the text and images is protected by copyright, the individual images generated by Midjourney themselves are not.14 This is a significant case that introduced a partial and 'thin' copyright concept for AI-assisted works.
    
- **_SURYAST_ and _Théâtre D'opéra Spatial_**: These cases further solidified the precedent set by _Zarya_. In the _SURYAST_ case, the applicant provided a photograph he took as a base image and Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night' as a style image to the AI. However, the USCO determined that "it was the AI that decided how to combine these two inputs into the final image," lacking human creative control.1
    
    _Théâtre D'opéra Spatial_, which gained attention for winning an award at the Colorado State Fair, was also denied copyright registration because the human contribution was limited to prompt input and minor post-production edits.25
    

#### **The Insufficiency of Prompts**

The USCO has clearly stated that, given the current state of technology, "prompt input alone does not provide sufficient human control to make users of an AI system the authors of the output."27 A prompt conveys an idea or concept, but the process of converting it into a specific expression is led by the AI and involves significant unpredictability.16

#### **South Korea's Position**

The Korea Copyright Commission (KCC) has also issued similar guidelines. While purely AI-generated works without human creative contribution are not eligible for copyright registration, parts that have been creatively modified, selected, or arranged by a human can be protected as copyrighted works.31 This position is nearly identical to the USCO's approach.

### **1.3 Contract vs. Law: The Role of AI Service Provider Terms of Use**

#### **The Promise of Ownership**

Most major AI service providers state in their Terms of Service (ToS) that the user owns the output they generate. This serves as an attractive condition for creators and businesses using their services.

- **OpenAI**: "OpenAI hereby assigns to you all its right, title, and interest in and to Output." 34
    
- **Midjourney**: "You own all Assets You create with the Services to the fullest extent possible under applicable law." 35
    
- **Google**: "Google won't claim ownership over that content." 37
    

#### **The Copyright Paradox: Contractual Ownership vs. Legal Non-Protection**

A significant paradox arises because the terms of AI service providers promise 'ownership' to users, but this does not mean full legal copyright. A step-by-step analysis of this structure is as follows:

1. AI service providers contractually assign their rights to the AI-generated output to the user through their terms of service.34 This is a business decision to make their services attractive to commercial users.39
    
2. However, as established in section 1.2, copyright laws in major countries, including the U.S. and South Korea, stipulate that works without sufficient 'human creative contribution' are not eligible for copyright protection.1
    
3. Works that cannot be protected by copyright legally belong to the 'public domain,' meaning anyone can freely copy and use them.13
    
4. Consequently, a user may 'own' the output within the contractual relationship with the AI provider, but may have no legal right to assert copyright against a third party to prevent copying or unauthorized use. In other words, the 'ownership' granted by the terms may not be an exclusive, worldwide copyright, but merely a contractual right against the service provider. This is a critical pitfall that can give users a false sense of legal protection.
    

#### **Grant-Back Licenses**

Furthermore, while users are granted ownership of the output through the terms, they simultaneously grant the AI provider a broad and perpetual license to use their prompts and the generated output for purposes such as service improvement and promotion.35 This means that the content the user believes they 'own' actually contributes to the AI company's asset growth.

## **Part II: Invisible Liability – Inherent Copyright Risks in AI Training Data**

To understand the legal issues of generative AI, one must address not only the output but also the underlying training data. The performance of AI models is determined by learning from vast amounts of data, and the potential for large-scale copyright infringement in this process is currently the biggest legal landmine shaking the entire AI industry. This chapter will examine the reality of AI training and the major lawsuits it has triggered, and analyze in depth how the AI developers' key defense, 'fair use,' is being challenged by recent changes in court precedents.

### **2.1 The Foundation of Generative AI: Large-Scale Copyrighted Data Training**

#### **The Scale of Reproduction**

Generative AI models, especially large language models (LLMs) and image generation models, are trained on billions or even trillions of data points collected from the internet. This data inevitably includes numerous copyrighted books, articles, images, and source code.45 The process of AI developers collecting this data, storing it on their servers, and using it for training can be considered a clear act of infringing the 'right of reproduction' under copyright law.1

#### **Major Lawsuit Cases**

This large-scale unauthorized reproduction has sparked strong opposition from creators, and several significant lawsuits are currently underway.

- **_The New York Times v. OpenAI & Microsoft_**: The New York Times alleges that millions of its articles were used without permission to train ChatGPT, and as a result, ChatGPT summarizes or provides nearly verbatim content from articles that are only available to paid subscribers, directly threatening its business model.46
    
- **_Getty Images v. Stability AI_**: The global stock image company Getty Images has filed a lawsuit alleging that the image generation AI Stable Diffusion was trained on more than 12 million of its photos without permission, and that distorted versions of Getty Images' watermark even appear in the generated images.53
    
- **Class Action Lawsuits by Authors and Artists**: Numerous authors and artists, including comedian Sarah Silverman, have filed class-action lawsuits alleging that their works were used for AI training without their consent or compensation.60
    

### **2.2 The Fair Use Defense: A Contested Legal Shield**

#### **The Four Factors**

In response to these lawsuits, the most powerful legal defense put forward by AI developers is 'fair use' under U.S. copyright law. Fair use is an exception that allows the use of copyrighted works without the owner's permission under certain conditions. Courts consider four factors in their judgment: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.1

#### **The 'Transformative Use' Argument and the _Google Books_ Precedent**

AI developers particularly argue that their actions fall under 'transformative use' in the first factor, 'the purpose and character of the use.' Their argument heavily relies on the ruling in _Authors Guild v. Google_ (the 'Google Books' case). In that case, the court ruled that Google's act of digitally scanning library books to create a searchable database was a 'transformative use' with a new purpose of information retrieval, rather than replacing the market for the original books, and thus constituted fair use.64 AI developers similarly argue that they are not displaying the copyrighted works but are extracting statistical patterns to create a new tool, the AI model, which is a transformative use.47

### **2.3 The _Warhol v. Goldsmith_ Precedent: A New Lens for Fair Use**

#### **Shift in the Supreme Court's Stance**

However, the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in _Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith_ marked a significant turning point in the analysis of fair use. In this case, the court ruled that the Andy Warhol Foundation's licensing of a silkscreen work based on a photograph of the musician Prince by photographer Lynn Goldsmith to a magazine did not constitute fair use. The court found that even though Warhol's work added new aesthetic meaning, its commercial 'purpose of use' (as a portrait for a magazine article) was substantially the same as the original photograph's purpose, thereby supplanting the licensing market for the original.71

#### **How the _Warhol_ Precedent Weakens the AI Fair Use Argument**

The _Warhol_ ruling could deal a significant blow to the fair use arguments of AI developers. The logical flow is as follows:

1. Before _Warhol_, the fair use argument for AI training, relying on the _Google Books_ precedent, focused on the AI model itself being a 'transformative' technology with a different purpose from the original works.
    
2. The _Warhol_ ruling shifted the focus of the analysis from the abstract 'transformativeness' of the technology to the specific 'use' of that technology and its 'commercial purpose.' The key question became, "Does the secondary use share the same or a very similar purpose as the original, and is it commercial in nature?"72
    
3. Generative AI is used to create outputs that directly compete in the same market as the works used for training. For example, an AI trained on news articles generates news summaries that can supplant the market for the original articles 50, and an AI trained on stock photos generates stock photos that can replace the original market.53
    
4. Therefore, under the _Warhol_ framework, the use of AI has a clear commercial purpose of directly replacing the market for the original works, making it very difficult to be recognized as fair use. This becomes a source of legal risk that extends not only to AI developers but also to the users of their outputs.
    

### **2.4 The European Framework: Text and Data Mining (TDM) Exceptions**

#### **Article 4 of the CDSM Directive**

The European Union (EU) takes a different approach. The 'Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM Directive),' enacted in 2019, includes explicit exceptions for text and data mining (TDM). Specifically, Article 4 allows for general TDM, including for commercial purposes, but stipulates that the exception does not apply if the copyright holder has "expressly reserved" their rights in a machine-readable format, such as a `robots.txt` file (opt-out).79

#### **Legal Uncertainty**

However, as this provision was designed before the advent of powerful generative AI, there is significant legal uncertainty as to whether it can be directly applied to the training of large-scale commercial AI models.83 The EU AI Act imposes an obligation on providers of general-purpose AI (GPAI) to comply with this opt-out provision and to disclose summary information about their training data, but the debate over the precise scope of TDM and the effectiveness of the opt-out continues.79

## **Part III: User-Facing Risks – Direct Infringement from AI Outputs**

The legal issues surrounding AI technology are not limited to the model training stage. The moment a user receives an output from an AI and incorporates it into their own work, a new level of direct legal liability can arise. This chapter will analyze in detail the most immediate threats users may face—copyright and trademark infringement risks—by combining technical causes with legal reasoning.

### **3.1 Copyright Infringement Risk**

#### **Regurgitation and Memorization: When AI's Memory Becomes the User's Responsibility**

The most direct copyright infringement risk for users stems from the phenomenon where an AI model 'regurgitates' its training data nearly verbatim.

- **Technical Cause**: This phenomenon is more of a technical flaw than a creative act by the AI. The primary cause is 'overfitting,' where the model memorizes specific data points instead of learning general patterns. This is more likely to occur when certain data is repeatedly included in the training dataset.86 If a model learns a particular passage or image too many times, it recognizes that content as a memorized answer rather than material for new creation and outputs it verbatim.
    
- **Legal Consequence**: If a user unknowingly uses such output in their blog, advertisement, or product, they can be held legally responsible for directly infringing the copyright of the original work. In _The New York Times_ lawsuit, the plaintiff presented concrete evidence that ChatGPT, with minimal prompting, reproduced entire paragraphs of its articles almost identically, highlighting this risk.46
    

#### **Derivative Works**

Even if the output is not identical to the training data, if it is 'substantially similar' to the creative expression of the original work, it can be considered an unauthorized creation of a derivative work, thus infringing copyright. Since AI combines the styles and elements of numerous works to generate output, there is always a possibility that an output will be generated that has a legally problematic level of similarity to one or more specific works.

### **3.2 Trademark Infringement and Dilution Risk**

Another significant legal risk, as important as copyright, is related to trademarks. Since AI also absorbs trademark-protected elements such as brand logos, product designs, and slogans as training data, it can cause various related problems.

#### **Likelihood of Confusion (Trademark Infringement)**

The core of trademark infringement is whether there is a likelihood of consumers being confused about the source of goods or services. If a user creates a logo or brand name using AI and uses it commercially, it can constitute trademark infringement if the output is similar to a registered trademark.93 In the

_Getty Images v. Stability AI_ lawsuit, it was alleged that images generated by Stable Diffusion included a distorted form of the Getty Images watermark, causing confusion about the source.53

#### **Dilution of Famous Marks**

In the case of famous trademarks, there is a risk of the mark's value being diminished even without a likelihood of confusion. This is called 'dilution,' and it primarily occurs in two forms.

- **Tarnishment**: This occurs when a famous mark is associated with low-quality, unethical, or unsavory content, damaging the brand's reputation. _The New York Times_ lawsuit directly addresses this issue. According to the complaint, AI chatbots have generated clear misinformation (hallucinations), such as "a Denver Post study showing that smoking can cure asthma," while citing The New York Times as the source. This, the lawsuit argues, is an act that damages the credibility and reputation of The New York Times brand.26
    
- **Blurring**: This occurs when a famous mark is used indiscriminately on various unrelated goods or services, weakening its unique distinctiveness. As AI can generate an infinite number of images that include a particular brand's logo or style, there is a risk that the unique image of that brand will become diluted and commonplace.97
    

Thus, in the process of utilizing AI outputs, users can face complex legal issues related not only to copyright but also to trademarks, which can lead to serious legal and financial risks, especially when creating content for commercial purposes.

## **Part IV: Risk Mitigation Framework – Contractual and Practical Safeguards**

In the complex and evolving legal landscape surrounding generative AI, users must seek multifaceted strategies to minimize potential liability. It is crucial to accurately understand the effectiveness of contractual protections offered by AI service providers, such as 'Copyright Shield' programs, while also proactively adopting practical measures to reduce legal risks in the creative process. This chapter will analyze in depth both the provider-side protections and user-side defensive strategies.

### **4.1 Provider-Side Protections: The Rise of 'Copyright Shield' Programs**

#### **IP Indemnification Policies**

As corporate customers' concerns about copyright infringement from AI-generated content grow, major AI providers are competitively introducing IP indemnification policies to protect users from certain copyright lawsuits arising from the use of their services.99 This is a contractual promise that if a user is sued by a third party for copyright infringement, the AI provider will defend the lawsuit and pay for any damages awarded in a final judgment or settlement.

#### **Limitations of Provider Indemnification and Risks Shifted to Users**

The IP indemnification clauses offered by AI providers are an important mechanism for alleviating the anxieties of enterprise users, but they are by no means a 'magic shield' that eliminates all risks. Behind these policies lie significant limitations and exceptions that users must be aware of.

1. Enterprise customers are concerned about the legal risks associated with using AI, which acts as a major barrier to the adoption of AI services. Consequently, to attract potential customers and enhance market competitiveness, major providers like Microsoft, Google, Adobe, and OpenAI have introduced 'Copyright Shield' programs or similar IP indemnification policies.101
    
2. However, these indemnification clauses do not provide unconditional protection. A close examination of the terms reveals common and significant exceptions. For example, OpenAI's indemnification does not apply if the user "knew or should have known the Output was infringing or likely to infringe" or if they did not use the provided safety filtering features.108 Microsoft also specifies that protection is only provided if the customer uses the built-in "guardrails and content filters."103
    
3. These exceptions shift a considerable level of due diligence and burden of proof to the user. In the event of a lawsuit, the AI provider could argue that the user 'should have known' that a particular output was potentially infringing or that they did not properly utilize the safety features, thereby avoiding their indemnification obligations.
    
4. As a result, these indemnification clauses change the nature of legal disputes. Users must now prepare not only for disputes with third-party copyright holders but also for potential disputes with their own AI provider over the applicability of the indemnification. Therefore, these 'protection programs' should be understood not as a device that completely eliminates risk, but as a contractual tool that can mitigate some risks and potentially change the parties to a dispute.
    

#### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Major Generative AI Provider IP Indemnification Policies**

|Provider|Program Name|Applicable Services|Protected Against|Key Exceptions and Conditions|Liability Cap|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**OpenAI**|Copyright Shield|ChatGPT Enterprise, API|Copyright Infringement|- User knew or should have known of infringement<br><br>- Safety filtering features disabled/ignored<br><br>- Output was modified<br><br>- Trademark infringement excluded 108|Fees paid in the last 12 months 109|
|**Microsoft**|Customer Copyright Commitment|Commercial Copilot services, Azure OpenAI Service|Copyright, Patent, Trademark, etc.|- Intentionally creating infringing material<br><br>- Not using provided safety features and content filters<br><br>- Inputting unauthorized data 103|Not specified (per agreement)|
|**Google**|Generative AI Indemnity|Duet AI in Workspace, Vertex AI, etc.|Copyright Infringement (Training data & generated output)|- Intentionally creating or using infringing material<br><br>- Not following responsible AI practices, such as using citation tools 102|General liability cap specified in the agreement|
|**Adobe**|Firefly IP Indemnification|Firefly features in certain enterprise plans|Copyright, Patent, Trademark, Publicity Rights, etc.|- Output from beta features<br><br>- User-added content (e.g., the shape of letters to which text effects are applied)<br><br>- Use in violation of terms 106|Per agreement|

### **4.2 User-Side Strategies for Responsible Creation**

As the protection offered by AI providers is incomplete, users must make active efforts to manage and minimize legal risks themselves.

#### **Defensive Prompt Engineering**

It is important to use prompt writing techniques that reduce the potential for legal disputes from the content generation stage.

- Avoid directly using proper nouns protected by copyright or trademark, such as the names of specific artists, characters, or brand names, in prompts. A prompt like "draw in the style of Van Gogh" could be interpreted as intentional imitation.113
    
- Instead, it is safer to guide the desired style by describing abstract artistic styles, color palettes, compositions, or moods. For example, it is better to give specific instructions on the expression, such as "use rough, thick brushstrokes and a swirling, dynamic sky."115
    
- Including negative prompts or explicit constraints in the prompt, such as "generate an original image" or "do not use existing characters or logos," can lower the probability of the AI generating potentially infringing output.113
    

#### **Due Diligence on Outputs**

Using AI-generated output as-is is risky. Before use, a minimal verification process should be conducted to ensure the output is not similar to existing works.

- **Reverse Image Search**: Tools like Google Image Search, TinEye, and Reversely.ai can be used to check if an AI-generated image is similar to other images on the web.119
    
- **Plagiarism and AI Checkers**: For text outputs, plagiarism checkers or AI content detectors can be used. However, these tools have clear limitations, as they may not perfectly detect sophisticated AI-generated text or may produce false positives, flagging human-written text as AI-generated.127
    
- **Acknowledge Limitations**: It is important to clearly recognize that these verification tools are not perfect and cannot determine conceptual similarity or legal 'substantial similarity.' They are a means of minimal risk assessment, not a guarantee of legal safety.132
    

#### **Documenting Human Creativity**

To claim copyright in an AI-assisted work, it is crucial to secure evidence that can prove human creative contribution.

- Go beyond simple prompt input and document in detail the entire process of refining prompts to achieve the desired output, the process of selecting and arranging specific outputs from multiple generated results, and the process of significantly modifying and combining the output with other elements using tools like Photoshop. This documentation can serve as key evidence to prove the 'human creative control' required by the USCO in future copyright registration applications or legal disputes.118 This is consistent with the logic in the
    
    _Zarya of the Dawn_ case, where the Copyright Office did not recognize copyright in the individual images but did recognize copyright in the 'selection and arrangement' of the text and images.
    

## **Conclusion: Navigating an Evolving Legal Landscape**

Generative AI technology is infinitely expanding the possibilities of creation, but its legal foundation remains fluid and uncertain. As analyzed in depth in this report, users should not be reassured by the fact that AI service providers grant 'ownership' through their terms. There is a clear gap between contractual ownership and an exclusive, legally protected and enforceable copyright.

The key points of the current legal landscape can be summarized as follows. First, the 'human author' principle remains a firm pillar of copyright law. Purely AI-generated works are likely to be unprotected by copyright and fall into the public domain, and to be recognized for copyright, one must prove substantial and creative human intervention. Second, the data collection that forms the basis of AI model training is hidden behind the shield of 'fair use,' but cracks have begun to appear in that shield since the _Warhol_ ruling. As courts place more emphasis on the commercial purpose of AI outputs and their effect on the original market, the legal risks for AI developers and users are bound to increase. Finally, users face the risk of becoming direct parties to legal liability due to 'output regurgitation' from AI's technical limitations and unintentional trademark infringement and dilution issues.

The 'Copyright Shield' programs offered by AI providers can mitigate some of these risks, but they are not a complete solution due to numerous exceptions. Ultimately, for now, users who utilize AI as a partner in the creative process must become 'responsible creators' who are aware of and manage legal risks themselves. This is possible through the practical efforts of acquiring defensive prompt engineering techniques, making a habit of conducting minimal rights checks on generated outputs, and meticulously documenting their own creative contribution process.

Going forward, the outcomes of major lawsuits like _The New York Times v. OpenAI_, further guidance from the U.S. Copyright Office and regulatory bodies in various countries, and the evolution of AI technology itself will continue to shape this legal landscape. Therefore, creators must pay continuous attention to these changes and exercise the wisdom to safely explore the infinite possibilities offered by technology within the legal framework.

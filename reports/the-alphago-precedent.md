_Gemini Deep Research_, _August 31, 2025_

Because the legal issues surrounding AI are still ongoing and not yet resolved, the situation may change significantly after the date of this report, and the legal advice below may no longer be valid.

## Prompt

> I think the most dangerous aspect of generative AI and copyright issues is whether it infringes on the commercial interests of copyright holders. People working in the creative field perceive this as a serious threat, not so much because they fear their work being infringed, but because they fear that AI-powered creations are sufficiently competitive and that the position of human creators is diminished.
> 
> While it's still unclear how the future will unfold, if there's one area that offers a hint, it's Go. Since AlphaGo, which learned using deep learning, Go has already left human hands and entered the realm of AI. Now, top-tier professional Go players are learning from AI.
> 
> Please find data on whether the market size and public perception of Go have changed since AI surpassed humans in Go skill.
> 
> And I believe that similar cases of AI cheating in the world of Baduk could arise between generative AI and creators. Please also investigate trends in AI cheating.

**Executive Summary**

The impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the creative sector extends beyond simple copyright infringement, heralding a structural shift that threatens the economic foundation and professional existence of human creators. This report argues that the essence of this threat is not merely the unauthorized reproduction of specific works but the 'economic displacement' caused by AI's ability to mass-produce creative content of competitive or superior quality, thereby eroding existing creative markets and diminishing the standing of human creators.

To analyze this phenomenon in depth, this report takes the changes experienced by the professional Go community since the advent of AlphaGo in 2016 as a key precedent. After AI conquered what was considered a pinnacle of human intelligence, the world of Go underwent fundamental changes in its market structure, the status of professional players, and the very nature of the game itself. The analysis reveals that while the prize money for top-tier players remained robust or even increased, the private tutoring market—a primary source of income for mid-tier players—contracted sharply as AI became a more efficient and affordable educational tool. This provides a crucial clue for predicting AI's impact on creative industries. A 'market without a middle class' may form, where a few 'superstar' creators leverage AI for greater success, while the majority of mid-tier creators lose their economic footing due to direct competition with AI.

Furthermore, the 'AI cheating' controversy in the Go community serves as a warning for how the authenticity of creative works and authorial credibility could be undermined in the age of generative AI. Cheating with AI transcends mere rule-breaking; it threatens the very values of human intellectual effort and fair competition. This suggests that in the creative domain, passing off AI-generated content as human work or the damage to a brand's or creator's reputation due to AI's 'hallucinations' could lead to new forms of intellectual property infringement and fraud.

In conclusion, the case of Go demonstrates that the future brought by generative AI is not just a technological advancement but a comprehensive transformation of economic, ethical, and legal paradigms. Based on this analysis, this report presents strategic directions for individual creators, the creative industry, and policymakers to navigate the coming changes.

## **Part I: The AlphaGo Effect: An In-Depth Analysis of the Professional Go Ecosystem in the Post-AI Era**

The victory of DeepMind's AlphaGo over world champion Lee Sedol was a symbolic milestone, signaling that artificial intelligence had surpassed what was considered a unique domain of human intellect. In the aftermath, the professional Go community experienced not just a shock but a structural transformation across its entire ecosystem. A close examination of this transformation provides the most significant precedent for predicting and preparing for the impact of generative AI on the creative industries.

### **1.1. Economic Realignment: Analyzing the Go Market After AI Supremacy**

Contrary to initial predictions that AlphaGo's emergence would lead to the complete collapse of the professional Go market, the market has instead reorganized into a complex and polarized form. The economic rewards for the top tier have been maintained or even strengthened, while the sector that formed the backbone of the professional Go ecosystem has been severely hit.

The prize money for top-ranked players has remained robust even after the AI shock. The total prize money for the top 10 players in the Korea Baduk Association's recent rankings reached approximately 4.36 billion KRW, with world number one Shin Jin-seo earning over 1.4 billion KRW for three consecutive years.1 Compared to 2010, when Lee Sedol was number one with an income of about 580 million KRW, the prize money for the top tier has actually increased.2 Furthermore, the establishment of a new major international tournament with a total prize pool of 1 billion KRW shows that the commercial value of Go competitions remains strong.3 This suggests that the value of contests between top human players, as a form of sports and entertainment, is being maintained regardless of AI's existence.

However, behind this stability at the top lies the collapse of a market that was fundamental to the professional Go community: the private tutoring and teaching game market. Demand for private lessons, which was a crucial source of income for professional players, especially those in the middle ranks, has plummeted since the advent of AI.4 Amateurs and aspiring professionals have begun to use AI programs as learning tools, which are available anytime, anywhere, at a low cost, and provide more accurate analysis than human professionals. As AI not only analyzed human game records and predicted next moves but also presented new joseki (standard opening sequences) and paradigms that humans had not understood, the educational authority of human professional players has largely been transferred to AI.

This market polarization offers significant implications for the future of the creative industries. The rise of AI is likely to cause not a complete disappearance of the creative market, but a rapid reorganization of its value chain. A few 'superstar' creators may leverage AI as a powerful tool to maximize productivity, open new creative horizons, and achieve greater commercial success. However, the 'middle market' that once sustained the livelihoods of many ordinary creators—such as stock photography, commercial illustration, and content marketing writing—is at direct risk of being replaced by the low-cost, high-efficiency outputs of AI. This could ultimately deepen a 'market without a middle class' structure, where the intermediate layer of 'professional' creators between a few top creators and many amateurs collapses. The reality in the Go world, where only about the top 50 players earn a significant income from tournament prizes 4, is a microcosm that hints at this future.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of the Professional Go Market (Pre- vs. Post-AlphaGo)**

|Metric|Pre-AlphaGo (as of 2010)|Post-AlphaGo (as of 2023)|Analysis of Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|**No. 1 Prize Money Ranking Income**|Approx. 580 million KRW (Lee Sedol) 2|Approx. 1.42 billion KRW (Shin Jin-seo) 1|Significant increase in top-tier compensation|
|**No. 10 Prize Money Ranking Income**|Data unavailable|Approx. 112 million KRW (Seol Hyun-jun) 1|High level of income still maintained|
|**Total for Top 10 Prize Money Rankings**|Data unavailable|Approx. 4.36 billion KRW 1|Concentration of wealth at the top|
|**Domestic Go Population (Estimate)**|Approx. 9.21 million (based on pre-2016 estimates) 5|Approx. 8.83 million 6|Overall decline in participation|
|**Primary Learning/Training Methods**|Tutoring by professional players, studying game records|Self-study and analysis using AI programs 4|AI replacing the human tutoring market|

This table clearly illustrates the structural changes in the Go market. While the prize money for the top players has increased, reinforcing a 'superstar economy,' the overall Go population has declined, and the shift in learning methods from human to AI has weakened the foundation of the professional Go ecosystem. This signifies not just a market contraction, but a profound reorganization where value is redistributed and the very nature of the profession is changing.

### **1.2. The Devaluation of Human Intuition: From Art to a Game of Finding the Right Answer**

The most fundamental change brought by AlphaGo was not just economic but philosophical. The status of Go as an 'art of human intuition,' built up over thousands of years, began to waver.

Today, without exception, the world's top professional Go players study the game with AI as their master. Shin Jin-seo calls himself a "player of the AI era" and defines AI as "a friend, a teacher, and something to be surpassed." 9 His nickname, 'Shin-gong-jineung' (a portmanteau of his name and the Korean word for AI), symbolizes his ability to best absorb and recreate AI's techniques.10 The training method has completely shifted from studying and reviewing the game records of past masters to analyzing one's own games with AI programs, checking changes in the win-rate graph, and learning the 'optimal moves' recommended by AI.4 Lee Sedol asserted that "past game records now have no special value other than for learning the history of Go," stating that it is more efficient to learn from AI because it can create more perfect game records.13

This change has led to the loss of the unique styles of individual professional players, or 'gipung' (棋風). Before AI, different styles like Lee Chang-ho's focus on territory, Lee Sedol's fighting style, and Cho Chi-hun's flexible moves were important elements that fans admired. Now, as all players try to imitate AI's style, the measure of skill has become 'who plays more like AI'.4 With the 'correct answer' for victory presented by AI, the artistic act of creating a work on the canvas of the Go board with one's own moves has gradually transformed into a problem-solving process of finding the right answer.

This 'crisis of purpose' was starkly revealed in Lee Sedol's shocking retirement announcement in 2019. He cited "AI is an entity that cannot be defeated" as one of the reasons for his retirement, expressing a sense of loss over the fading artistry of Go.4 A fundamental doubt had sprouted about the reason for a professional player's existence, who must aim for the top in a field where humans can no longer be the best.

This is a powerful warning to creators. If generative AI can present a particular style of painting or music in a form that is 'most likely to be commercially successful,' creators may be pressured to imitate the 'correct answers' presented by AI for economic survival. In this process, the unique originality and experimental spirit of human creators could be stifled, and culture as a whole could converge towards the average values presented by AI, leading to a 'homogenization of style.' This is a threat on a deeper level than just losing jobs; it is about losing the essential meaning and purpose of the creative act itself.

### **1.3. A Tale of Two Games: Why Chess Thrived and Go Stagnated**

Go is not the only game to have its human champion conquered by AI. Chess faced the AI era about 20 years earlier, in 1996, when IBM's 'Deep Blue' defeated the then-world champion Garry Kasparov. However, the subsequent paths of the two games have diverged sharply. While the popularity of Go has stagnated or declined, chess has experienced a second golden age.5

The key to chess's success lies in its cultural and industrial shift away from a human-versus-AI confrontation to a model that actively utilizes AI to maximize the enjoyment of 'human versus human' competition. The world's largest online chess platform, 'Chess.com,' has formed a massive community with over 100 million members, and its market size is estimated in the trillions of won.5 At the heart of this revival are young superstars like Hikaru Nakamura. They are not only exceptionally skilled but also actively engage on new media platforms like YouTube and Twitch, successfully rebranding chess as a 'young and dynamic game'.5 In their broadcasts, AI is used as a powerful auxiliary tool to analyze games and help viewers understand. In other words, AI has become not a competitor that takes away human jobs, but a commentator and partner that makes human play more exciting.

Furthermore, the chess world was quick to address the issue of AI cheating. Online platforms operate their own anti-cheating teams, and offline tournaments have introduced strong preventive measures such as metal detector checks and broadcast delays to protect the integrity of the competition.5

In contrast, the Go community has been relatively slow to adapt to these changes. It has yet to shed its old-fashioned image as a 'hobby for older men,' and AI cheating scandals have damaged the credibility of tournaments.5 The closure of Myongji University's Department of Baduk Studies and cuts in government funding are symbolic events that illustrate this decline.5

The contrasting fates of Go and chess offer an important lesson for the creative fields. Survival may depend not on the technology itself, but on how it is embraced to create new culture and value. If human creators become solely focused on competing with the quality of AI-generated outputs, they will inevitably lose out in the race for price and speed. However, like the case of chess, if AI is used as a tool to highlight human creativity, and if creators focus on generating 'cultural value' that AI cannot replace—such as personal narratives, individuality, and communication with fans—new opportunities can be found. Ultimately, the success of the future creative industry will depend not on resistance to technology, but on the ability to embrace it and build a new cultural ecosystem.

## **Part II: A Crisis of Integrity: AI Cheating as a Precursor to Creative Fraud**

The issue of cheating using AI in the Go community is more than just a violation of sportsmanship. It is a microcosm that shows how fundamental values like human intellectual achievement and fair competition can be threatened by technology. It is also a clear preview of how the authenticity of creative works, the credibility of authors, and the boundaries of intellectual property can be eroded in the age of generative AI.

### **2.1. Case Studies from the Go World: The Kim Eun-ji and Li Xuanhao Controversies**

The severity of AI cheating sent shockwaves through the Go community with two major incidents. The first involved Kim Eun-ji, then a 13-year-old hailed as a 'Go prodigy' in South Korea, in 2020. She was found to have used an AI program for assistance during an online tournament, the 'ORO Kuksu Championship,' and was suspended for one year.14 Suspicions arose from an analysis of her moves' high match rate with AI recommendations, and she eventually confessed.16 This incident served as a wake-up call, revealing the vulnerability of online competitions and the fact that even a promising young player could fall prey to the temptation of cheating.4

The second was an international controversy involving China's Li Xuanhao in 2022. When Li, whose skills had rapidly improved beyond his mid-20s, defeated the world's number one player, Shin Jin-seo, in the Chunlan Cup, his fellow professional Yang Dingxin publicly accused him of cheating.17 Yang claimed that Li's game record showed an unrealistic match rate of 85-90% with AI recommendations and even proposed a 20-game match under controlled conditions, with his retirement on the line.19 Although the lack of concrete evidence meant no disciplinary action was taken, the incident exposed the deep-seated distrust among top-tier professional players. Interestingly, suspicions were further fueled when Li's performance sharply declined after the Chinese Weiqi Association strengthened anti-cheating measures, such as installing Wi-Fi signal jammers.22

These incidents show how the mere existence of AI can contaminate the field of competition with distrust. In response, the Go community has entered an 'arms race,' strengthening technical and physical preventive measures such as banning electronic devices in the playing area, introducing metal detectors, and blocking communication signals.23 While these are necessary measures to maintain a fair competitive environment, they also represent a somber reality where the essence of Go as a pure intellectual duel is being altered by technological surveillance and control.

### **2.2. A New Form of Plagiarism: Generative AI and the Challenge to Authenticity**

AI cheating in the Go world is directly linked to new forms of intellectual property infringement and fraudulent activities that can occur in the creative domain. This raises complex issues that go beyond the traditional concept of plagiarism.

The most direct parallel is 'author impersonation.' A student submitting an essay written by AI or a writer publishing a novel generated by AI as their own work is essentially the same as Kim Eun-ji playing AI's moves as her own. Traditional plagiarism detection software, which works by checking for text matches with other literature, has difficulty detecting 'original' text newly generated by AI.26 This is a problem that fundamentally shakes the evaluation criteria for academic and creative achievement and results in the devaluation of genuine human effort.

Furthermore, AI can unintentionally, yet more severely, damage a brand's credibility and value. This leads to the issue of 'Trademark Dilution.' A prime example is the _The New York Times v. OpenAI_ lawsuit. The New York Times took issue with the 'hallucination' phenomenon, where ChatGPT, after learning from its articles, would summarize the content or sometimes create false information, citing The New York Times as the source. They argued that this act of associating the New York Times trademark with false or low-quality content constitutes 'tarnishment,' damaging the brand's reputation.29 Similarly, in the

_Getty Images v. Stability AI_ lawsuit, the issue was the appearance of a distorted version of the Getty Images watermark in AI-generated images. The claim was that this causes confusion about the source of the image, implying an association with Getty Images and diluting the brand's value.32

These phenomena raise a different level of problem from cheating in Go. In Go, a human 'uses' AI to cheat, but in the creative domain, the AI itself can become the agent that damages the reputation of a specific brand or creator by 'generating' inaccurate or distorted information. This is a systemic risk inherent in the AI technology itself, beyond an individual's malicious intent. Therefore, 'AI cheating' in the creative domain must be addressed on two fronts simultaneously: the problem of 'individual fraud,' such as intentional author impersonation, and the problem of 'systemic misinformation' arising from the technical limitations of AI.

### **2.3. The Technical and Legal Arms Race: Detection, Mitigation, and Liability**

In response to AI cheating and new forms of plagiarism, technology, law, and market participants have entered a complex 'arms race.' This shows that, just as the Go community introduced electronic device detectors, various response strategies are being explored in the creative domain.

At the forefront of the technical response are AI detection tools. Services like Turnitin and Grammarly are attempting to distinguish between human and AI-generated writing by analyzing the unique statistical patterns of AI-generated text.26 However, these tools are not perfect and have high false-positive rates, such as misidentifying the writing of non-native English speakers as AI-generated.27 As generative AI models continue to advance, detection technology is in a constant race to keep up.

AI developers, recognizing the seriousness of the problem, are also introducing technical mitigation measures. The phenomenon of 'information regurgitation,' where a model memorizes and outputs its training data verbatim, can be a direct cause of copyright infringement. To prevent this, developers are implementing measures such as removing duplicate content from training data (data deduplication), making the model 'forget' specific information (machine unlearning), and filtering systems to screen out harmful or potentially infringing content.37 They also provide 'prompt engineering' guidelines to prevent users from intentionally inducing infringing outputs through their prompts.41

However, the most notable change is occurring at the legal and economic levels. Major AI companies like Microsoft, Google, Adobe, and OpenAI have introduced 'Copyright Shield' or 'IP Indemnity' clauses for their paid enterprise customers.44 This is a promise that if a customer is sued by a third party for copyright infringement due to the output generated by their AI tools, the company will cover the legal defense costs and damages.

The emergence of these indemnity clauses is a very important market signal. It is a de facto admission by AI companies that technical means alone cannot completely eliminate the risk of copyright infringement. Instead of solving the technical problem, they are managing potential legal liability as a manageable business risk by converting it into a financial product like insurance. However, this shield comes with important limitations. It generally does not apply to free users, and it is excluded from indemnification if the user intentionally induced the infringement or did not use the safety filters provided by the company.44 Ultimately, this creates a kind of class system in AI use. Large corporate customers who pay hefty license fees are protected from legal risks, while individual creators, small businesses, and general users are left exposed to potential litigation risks. This transforms a problem of technical fairness into one of economic liability, creating a competitive environment that is overwhelmingly favorable to players with capital.

## **Part III: Strategic Imperatives for Human Creators in the AI Era**

The changes in the Go world after AlphaGo and the crisis of integrity caused by AI cheating provide an important lens through which to view the future that human creators will face in the age of generative AI. The insights gained from this not only help in recognizing the threats but also suggest concrete strategic directions for human creators to survive and thrive in a changing environment.

### **3.1. Redefining Value Beyond the Output: Lessons from Go and Chess**

In an era where AI can produce a near-infinite amount of content at near-zero marginal cost, the economic value of the 'output' itself is bound to decline. As seen in the case of the Go world, the collapse of the tutoring market for mid-tier players, who could no longer offer a 'move' more accurate and efficient than AI, is evidence of this.

In this environment, human creators must focus on values that AI cannot replicate. The reason chess was able to revive even after being conquered by AI is that it shifted the focus of competition from a 'human vs. machine' performance battle to a narrative and community of 'human vs. human.' In other words, the source of value moved from the craft itself to the culture.

Therefore, future human creators must create new value in the following areas:

- **Authenticity and Personal Narrative:** The artist's experience, philosophy, and the story of the creative process itself, embedded in the work, hold a unique value that AI cannot imitate.
    
- **Bond with the Community:** The process of directly communicating with fans, receiving feedback, and building a world of work together forms strong loyalty.
    
- **Live Experience:** The value of direct experiences that can only be felt on-site, such as performances, exhibitions, and meetings with the artist, will become even more important.
    
- **Curation of Taste:** The role of a curator who not only produces content but also selects and reinterprets it based on a specific taste and perspective will rise.
    

Ultimately, the value of the future will shift from 'what' was made (the what) to 'who, how, and why' it was made (the who, how, and why). AI should be used as a collaborative tool to realize a human's unique vision, but the final emphasis of value must be placed on the creator's brand and their relationship with their fans.

### **3.2. Navigating the Legal Maze: The Two Pillars of AI Copyright Law**

The current legal debate surrounding generative AI is unfolding around two main axes. Creators must clearly understand these two streams to protect their rights and minimize legal risks.

#### **Pillar 1: The Issue of Copyright Attribution for AI-Generated Works**

The firm principle of the current U.S. legal system is that 'human authorship' is essential for copyright protection.55 Works generated purely by AI are considered to lack human creative intervention and are therefore not eligible for copyright protection, thus falling into the public domain.57

This principle has been solidified through several court cases and decisions by the U.S. Copyright Office. Notably, in the _Thaler v. Perlmutter_ case, the court rejected the claim to recognize an AI system itself as an author.62 Also, in the case of the graphic novel

_Zarya of the Dawn_, the Copyright Office recognized the copyright for the text written by the author and the 'selection and arrangement' of the images, but not for the individual images generated using AI (Midjourney).63 This is an important case showing that the scope of copyright recognition can vary depending on the degree of human creative intervention.

What creators need to be wary of here is the 'illusion of service terms.' Most AI companies like OpenAI and Midjourney state in their Terms of Service that they 'assign' the 'ownership' of the generated output to the user.67 However, this is merely a contractual promise between the company and the user and does not mean that a copyright has legally been established. In other words, the user is contractually receiving 'ownership' of content that may not be legally protected. This is more of a strategic move by companies to absolve themselves of legal responsibility for the output and to encourage the use of their platforms.

#### **Pillar 2: The Issue of Legality of AI Training Data**

The most intense battlefront in the current AI copyright debate is whether the unauthorized collection and reproduction of vast amounts of copyrighted works to train AI models constitutes 'fair use.' The _New York Times v. OpenAI_ case and the past _Authors Guild v. Google_ case are representative examples that deal with the core of this issue.75

AI companies argue that their actions are fair use because they are not simply reproducing the original works but are creating a new 'transformative' work—the AI model. However, the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in _Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith_ put a brake on this argument.81 In this ruling, the Supreme Court held that a secondary work is not transformative just because it contains a new meaning or message; it is important to consider whether it is used for the 'same or similar commercial purpose' as the original work. According to this logic, an AI that generates images by imitating the style of a specific artist directly competes with the market for that artist's work, making it difficult to be recognized as fair use.

These two legal pillars create a paradoxical situation of 'The Great Decoupling of Ownership and Protection.' AI service terms grant users 'ownership' of the output, but current copyright law largely denies the 'protectability' of that output. For example, suppose a company creates a logo using AI and treats it as a brand asset. The company 'owns' the logo according to the service terms, but if that logo is deemed to lack sufficient human creative intervention, it may not be protected by copyright. This means that even if a competitor copies and uses that logo, there may be no legal way to stop them. This gap between ownership and legal protectability creates serious legal uncertainty for creators and businesses that rely on AI-generated assets.

### **3.3. Recommendations for a Sustainable Creative Ecosystem**

Synthesizing the precedents from the Go world and the ongoing legal and technical debates, human creators, related industries, and policymakers should explore the following multifaceted strategies.

#### **For Individual Creators:**

1. **Thorough Documentation of the Creative Process:** To prove human creative contribution in AI-assisted creation, every step of the process must be meticulously documented. It is important to systematically preserve materials that can prove human intervention, such as initial idea sketches, the specific development and revision process of prompts, the selection and arrangement of AI-generated outputs, and post-generation editing work. This was the key criterion that distinguished the parts where the Copyright Office recognized human authorship (text, arrangement) from the parts it did not (individual images) in the _Zarya of the Dawn_ case.
    
2. **Utilize AI as a Tool, Not the Creator:** The focus should be on using AI as a 'tool' that assists and expands human creativity—for brainstorming, initial draft creation, and automating repetitive tasks—rather than handing over the creative lead to AI. The final product must clearly show original modifications, edits, and artistic judgments that only a human can make.
    
3. **Build a Personal Brand:** In an era where it is difficult to differentiate based on the output alone, the creator's own name, story, and fan community become the most important assets. Creators should share their creative philosophy, actively communicate with fans through social media, and establish themselves as a trusted 'brand' beyond being a mere content supplier.
    

#### **For the Creative Industry:**

1. **Develop New Licensing Models:** Rather than waiting for final court rulings, the industry should take the lead in developing new licensing models that include a fair compensation system for the use of AI training data. This is the path to building a symbiotic ecosystem that guarantees fair compensation for creators and provides legal stability for AI companies.
    
2. **Invest in Provenance Technology:** Actively adopt and promote technology standards that transparently record and disclose the origin and creation process of creative works, such as Adobe's 'Content Credentials'.87 This will allow for a clear distinction between human-made works, AI-assisted works, and purely AI-generated works, thereby restoring consumer trust in content and protecting creators' rights.
    

#### **For Policymakers:**

1. **Clarify Fair Use Standards for AI Training:** Legislative or clear judicial guidelines on the fair use of AI training data, a key issue in ongoing lawsuits, should be established promptly. This is the most urgent and important task that will determine the economic future of creative professions.
    
2. **Establish Policies to Encourage Human Creativity:** The logic of a market economy driven by AI may make it difficult to sustain diverse and experimental human creative activities. Policy incentives that directly support human creators and recognize their social value should be put in place to protect cultural diversity.
    
3. **Strive for International Legal Harmonization:** Major countries such as the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China are taking different legal approaches to AI-generated works, increasing legal uncertainty globally.88 Considering the transnational nature of AI technology, active discussion and cooperation between countries are needed to establish more consistent international norms.
